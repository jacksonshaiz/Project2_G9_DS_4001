## Data Summary
Our goal is to create a model that tracks the trends of the top stocks currently in the Vanguard ETF Growth fund and predicts with an accuracy of 75% or higher their trends, providing recommendations on which ones to invest in or sell. We used Yahoo Finance’s Python package to collect the data on the top stocks in the VUG.

## Provenance
The data for this project was pulled from Yahoo Finance’s stock index. The data has not been altered and remains what we pulled from the website. All information is reflected as is posted on Yahoo Finance’s website.
